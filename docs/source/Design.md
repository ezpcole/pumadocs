### Fusion 360

The flagship CAD software, which is included in your school tuition as per request to June (j.peters@universityprep.org). Getting a license for Fusion 360 requires you to talk to them, so if you wish to obtain a license, talk to them. If you wish to be included in the Fusion Hub which includes the VEX parts library, please talk to Eza (e.cole@universityprep.org) in person, or by email (preferably in person).  
Fusion 360 contains the most features, including custom drawings, cloud-based files (but local rendering), and rigid groups (which allow for moving a group of parts very easily). It also includes some parts (like boogie wheels) that other libraries may not even have access to.  
Overall, this software is a very rigid choice for teams deciding to design. However, teams deciding to pick this software should be aware of its drawbacks: It is very performance intensive, as it uses lots of resources, requiring a very powerful computer in order to run with consistent 60-fps. It also has a steep learning curve, meaning that teams opting to use this software should be prepared to spend a lot of time learning the software, and be prepared for lag (if using without a powerful computer). Also, the parts library is not included in the software, so users must either join Eza’s Fusion Hub or install the library themselves (available at this GitHub repository, and at this Discord Server).

### Onshape

Onshape is a CAD software which is free for students to use without needing to request June, just requiring users to provide a school email when signing up here. It is also web based, meaning that it can run on most computers, and almost never crashes, making it very stable. Its part library also is not included, however is very easy to install and well documented. Similar to Fusion, it is very laggy, much more than Fusion due to its web rendering. It’s a very good starting point for new teams (similar to Protobot), however it also has a learning curve (although not that steep). It is usable for advanced teams as well, but Fusion should be preferred.

### Protobot

Protobot is a beginner friendly CAD software specifically designed for VEX Robotics. It can be found here. It has many parts from the vex library, and is extremely lightweight and easy to learn. For these qualities, it makes it a very good software for beginner teams, especially in their first year. It is not sustainable however, as it lacks custom drawings, and does not offer constraints that keep parts in place, meaning that moving many parts at once is hard. It is also local-based, making it difficult to sync with team members.
